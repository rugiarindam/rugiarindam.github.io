---

Here are some expository writings of mine over the years. Scroll below to find some more writings from my high school days.

### Undergraduate Writings

* [Log-Concave Polynomials](#): Prepared an expository report on the technique of log-concave polynomials, especially as pioneered by [Shayan Oveis Gharan](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shayan/) and others. Covered deterministic matroid base counting algorithms, proof of Mason’s conjecture, and an introduction to spectral independence.
* [Sum-of-Squares Hierarchy](#): Prepared an report of the Sum-of-Squares Hierarchy from [Pravesh Kothari](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~praveshk/)’s lecture series on the same, and covered Goemans-Williamson’s Max-Cut algorithm, Nesterov’s \\(\pi/2\\)-theorem, Arora-Rao-Vazirani’s conductance algorithm, Grigoriev’s lower bounds on the k-XOR problem through SoS, and SoS vs. spectral refutation algorithms.
* [Percolation Theory](#): Prepared an expository writing on the calculation of the critical probability for bond percolation on \\(\mathbb{Z}^2\\), one of the most fundamental results of percolation theory
* [Coding Theory](#): Prepared a report of coding theory from Atri, Guruswami, and Sudan’s book on the same, and cov-
ered Derivative, Folded Reed-Solomon codes, Algebraic-Geometric Codes, and BCH codes, and also covered List Decoding of Reed-Solomon codes, Elias-Bassalygo and Johnson bounds
* [Dirichlet Energy](#): Studied the use of Dirichlet Forms on reversible ergodic Markov chains to derive bounds regarding their relaxation time from this monograph by Aldous and Fill, and prepared a report on the same
* [A Survey of the Graham-Pollak Theorem](#): Made a brief survey of the Graham-Pollak theorem and various associated results
* [The Goldreich-Levin Theorem](#): Studied the proof of the Goldreich-Levin theorem, and presented an expository report on the same
* [Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé games](#): Explored the Methodology theorem and Hanf’s theorem from the book Descriptive Complexity by Neil Immerman, and prepared a report on the same
* [Group Theory Exercises](#):
