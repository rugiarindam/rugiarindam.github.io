### Undergraduate Writings

* [Log-Concave Polynomials](#): Prepared an expository report on the technique of log-concave polynomials, especially as pioneered by [Shayan Oveis Gharan](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shayan/) and others. Covered deterministic matroid base counting algorithms, proof of Mason’s conjecture, and an introduction to spectral independence.
* [Sum-of-Squares Hierarchy](#): Prepared an report of the Sum-of-Squares Hierarchy from [Pravesh Kothari](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~praveshk/)’s lecture series on the same, and covered Goemans-Williamson’s Max-Cut algorithm, Nesterov’s \\(\pi/2\\)-theorem, Arora-Rao-Vazirani’s conductance algorithm, Grigoriev’s lower bounds on the \\(k\\)-XOR problem through SoS, and SoS vs. spectral refutation algorithms.
* [Percolation Theory](#): Prepared an expository writing on the calculation of the critical probability for Bernoulli percolation on \\(\mathbb{Z}^2\\), one of the most fundamental results of percolation theory
* [Coding Theory](#): Prepared a report of coding theory from Atri, Guruswami, and Sudan’s book on the same, and covered Derivative, Folded Reed-Solomon codes, Algebraic-Geometric Codes, and BCH codes, and also covered List Decoding of Reed-Solomon codes, Elias-Bassalygo and Johnson bounds
* [Dirichlet Energy](#): Studied the use of Dirichlet Forms on reversible ergodic Markov chains to derive bounds regarding their relaxation time from [this](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/aldous/RWG/book.html) monograph by Aldous and Fill
* [A Survey of the Graham-Pollak Theorem](#): Made a brief survey of the Graham-Pollak theorem and various associated results, such as Alon's bounds on \\(t\\)-biclique coverings of complete graphs, and the Szemerédi-Katona theorem
* [The Goldreich-Levin Theorem](#): Studied the proof of the Goldreich-Levin theorem, and presented it (you can find the [slides here](#))
* [Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé games](#): Explored the Methodology theorem and Hanf’s theorem (and their applications in proving the non-FO expressibility of various predicates) from the book [Descriptive Complexity](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4612-0539-5) by Neil Immerman
* [Group Theory Exercises](#): Solved an exhaustive variety of group theory and ring theory exercises from [I.N. Herstein](https://marinazahara22.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/i-n-herstein-topics-in-algebra-2nd-edition-1975-wiley-international-editions-john-wiley-and-sons-wie-1975.pdf) and [Dummitt and Foote](https://handoutset.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Abstract-Algebra-3rd-Edition-David-S.-Dummit-Richard-M.-Foote.pdf)'s classic books on the same
