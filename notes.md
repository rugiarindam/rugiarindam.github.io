### Undergraduate Writings

1. [Log-Concave Polynomials](./Expository_Writings/log_concave_polynomials.pdf){:target="_blank"}: Prepared an expository report on the technique of log-concave polynomials, especially as pioneered by [Shayan Oveis Gharan](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shayan/){:target="_blank"}, [Nima Anari](https://nimaanari.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Kuikui Liu](https://dblp.org/pid/230/3619.html){:target="_blank"}, and [Cynthia Vinzant](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~vinzant/){:target="_blank"}. Covered a proof of Mason’s conjecture, and deterministic and randomized matroid base counting algorithms, including a proof of the Mihail-Vazirani conjecture.
2. [Sum-of-Squares Hierarchy](./Expository_Writings/SoS.pdf){:target="_blank"}: Prepared an report of the Sum-of-Squares Hierarchy from [Pravesh Kothari](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~praveshk/){:target="_blank"}’s lecture series on the same, and covered Goemans-Williamson’s Max-Cut algorithm, Nesterov’s \\(\pi/2\\)-theorem, Arora-Rao-Vazirani’s conductance algorithm, Grigoriev’s lower bounds on the \\(k\\)-XOR problem through SoS, and SoS vs. spectral refutation algorithms.
3. [Percolation Theory](./Expository_Writings/percolation_theory.pdf){:target="_blank"}: Prepared an expository writing on the calculation of the critical probability for Bernoulli percolation on \\(\mathbb{Z}^2\\), one of the most fundamental results of percolation theory.
4. [Coding Theory](./Expository_Writings/Coding_Theory.pdf){:target="_blank"}: Prepared a report of coding theory from Guruswami, Rudra, and Sudan’s book on the same, and covered Derivative, Folded Reed-Solomon codes, Algebraic-Geometric Codes, and BCH codes, and also covered List Decoding of Reed-Solomon codes, Elias-Bassalygo and Johnson bounds.
5. [Dirichlet Energy](./Expository_Writings/Dirichlet_Energy.pdf){:target="_blank"}: Studied the use of Dirichlet Forms on reversible ergodic Markov chains to derive bounds regarding their relaxation time from [this](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/aldous/RWG/book.html){:target="_blank"} monograph by Aldous and Fill. You can find the [slides here](./Expository_Writings/Dirichlet_Energy_Slides.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
6. [Stochastic Differential Equations](./Expository_Writings/Stochastic_Differential_Equations.pdf){:target="_blank"}: Covered the basics of Itô calculus and stochastic differential equations (from [Bernt Oksendal's book](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-14394-6){:target="_blank"} on the same), and prepared a "cheatsheet" of sorts, summarizing the main notions and formulae.
6. [A Survey of the Graham-Pollak Theorem](./Expository_Writings/Graham_Pollak_Survey.pdf){:target="_blank"}: Made a brief survey of the Graham-Pollak theorem and various associated results, such as Alon's bounds on \\(t\\)-biclique coverings of complete graphs, and the Szemerédi-Katona theorem.
7. [The Goldreich-Levin Theorem](./Expository_Writings/Goldreich_Levin.pdf){:target="_blank"}: Studied the proof of the Goldreich-Levin theorem, and presented it (you can find the [slides here](./Expository_Writings/GL_Slides.pdf){:target="_blank"}).
8. [Exact Exponential Algorithms](./Expository_Writings/BTP_thesis.pdf){:target="_blank"}: Studied Zamir’s work on breaking the \\(2^n\\)-barrier for 5-coloring, in the process picking up tools such as Yates’ fast zeta transform, and inclusion-exclusion methods for improving exponential algorithms, and presented it (you can find the [slides here](./Expository_Writings/BTP_slides.pdf){:target="_blank"}).
9. [Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé games](./Expository_Writings/EF_Games.pdf){:target="_blank"}: Explored the Methodology theorem and Hanf’s theorem (and their applications in proving the non-FO expressibility of various predicates) from the book [Descriptive Complexity](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4612-0539-5){:target="_blank"} by Neil Immerman.
10. [A DFA Trick](./Expository_Writings/DFA_trick.pdf){:target="_blank"}: I came up with a useful trick to prove the regularity of languages, which simplifies many typical exercises in an automata theory course.
11. [Group Theory Exercises](./Expository_Writings/Group_Theory_Exercises.pdf){:target="_blank"}: Solved an exhaustive variety of group theory and ring theory exercises from [I.N. Herstein](https://marinazahara22.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/i-n-herstein-topics-in-algebra-2nd-edition-1975-wiley-international-editions-john-wiley-and-sons-wie-1975.pdf){:target="_blank"} and [Dummitt and Foote](https://handoutset.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Abstract-Algebra-3rd-Edition-David-S.-Dummit-Richard-M.-Foote.pdf){:target="_blank"}'s classic books on the same.


### High School and Early Undergraduate Writings

1. [Dense Divisors of the Null Matrix](./High_School/Dense_divisors_of_a_null_matrix.pdf){:target="_blank"}: Proved quick bound regarding the density (defined as the number of non-zero entries of a matrix divided by the size of total number of entries in the matrix) of matrices which multiply with each other to give the null matrix.
2. [A Number Theoretic Identity](./High_School/A_Number_Theory_Theorem.pdf){:target="_blank"}: Proved an amusing number theoretic identity by counting the number of edges of a certain poset .
3. [Fullerenes](./High_School/Fullerenes_CALE_Submission.pdf){:target="_blank"}: Wrote an article explaining why all fullerenes have exactly 12 pentagonal faces.
4. [Silicates](./High_School/silicates_CALE_Submission.pdf){:target="_blank"}: Calculated the exact formulae of various silicate polymers.
5. [Copper Compound Complexes](./High_School/CopperCompoundColors.pdf){:target="_blank"}: Verified the predictions of Crystal Field Theory regarding the colors of copper compounds.
