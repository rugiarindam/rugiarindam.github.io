I have TA'd for 4 courses so far at IIT Bombay, and I've enjoyed this experience a lot. Among other things, my experience has involved conducting tutorials (recitations), grading assignments and examination papers, and clearing student queries personally. Some courses I have TA'd for are:
* MA109 (Calculus), Fall 2021
* MA106 (Linear Algebra), Spring 2022
* CS228 (Logic for Computer Science), Spring 2023: I prepared [LaTeXed solutions](https://github.com/arponbasu/CS228_Tut_Solutions){:target="_blank"} to the tutorials for this course, which were referred to by hundreds of juniors.
* CS215 (Data Analysis and Interpretation), Fall 2023
